<summary>What is a Dual Power Gathering?</summary>

The Dual Power Gatherings are events meant to bring together those who want to turn momentum into action. Dual Power is not a centralized organization, but it is an informal confederation of collectives working towards the goal of bringing people into conversation and building relationships of solidarity.

We are seeking to bring together people and organizations who have been on the front lines of these fights for a weekend of discussion, skill building, sharing lessons learned, strategizing and networking by members of:
    
- Tenant unions
- Worker Cooperatives and Cooperative networks
- Food sovereignty/Permaculture/Urban Agriculture projects
- Mutual aid networks
- Rank and file/Solidarity unions
- Independent caucus unions
- Community and Regional assemblies
- Labor councils
- Prison and Police Abolitionists
- Prisoner support organizations
- Solidarity economy organizations
- Community defense networks
- Street Medic and harm reduction collectives
- Workers centers
- Houseless unions
- Autonomous Indigenous Communities
- Environmental Direct Action/Water Protector networks
- Intentional communities/housing cooperatives and Community Land Trusts
- Health and bodily autonomy organizers
- Education collectives and cooperatives
- Mental Health cooperatives/collectives

We also welcome those who are not currently affiliated with an organization. We want you here if you are dedicated to a world free of all forms of oppressive hierarchy.
