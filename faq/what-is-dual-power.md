## What is dual power?

Dual power is a strategy that builds liberated spaces and creates social structures grounded in direct democracy. Together these spaces and durable organizations expand into the ever widening formation of a "new world in the shell of the old." As movements and communities grow more powerful, they can engage in ever larger confrontations and disruptions against the ruling class order—so that they may ultimately contest the legitimacy of the institutions of capitalist society.

Dual power is comprised of two component parts: 

1. **building counter-structures** that serve as alternatives to the structures currently governing production, investment, and social life under capitalism; and
2. organizing through and **confederating these structures to build up a base of grassroots counter-power.**

Both steps are necessary to challenging and eventually overthrowing all forms of oppression including patriarchy, white supremacy, and settler colonialism that prop up the power of capitalists and the State.
