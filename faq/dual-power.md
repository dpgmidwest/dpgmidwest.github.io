<summary>What is dual power?</summary>

Dual power is a strategy that builds liberated spaces and creates social structures grounded in direct democracy. Together these spaces and durable organizations expand into the ever widening formation of a "new world in the shell of the old." As movements and communities grow more powerful, they can engage in ever larger confrontations and disruptions against the ruling class orderâ€”so that they may ultimately contest the legitimacy of the institutions of capitalist society.

Dual power is comprised of two component parts: 

1. **building counter-structures** that serve as alternatives to the structures currently governing production, investment, and social life under capitalism; and
2. organizing through and **confederating these structures to build up a base of grassroots counter-power.**

Both steps are necessary to challenging and eventually overthrowing all forms of oppression including patriarchy, white supremacy, and settler colonialism that prop up the power of capitalists and the State.
