<summary>What do endorsements mean?</summary>

An endorsement means the organization in question agrees with what the event hopes to achieve and is willing to spread with word with their network. This builds a network of accountability and community between organizations.

Essentially they are saying the event seems cool (and they trust that the event will be beneficial).
