      DPG Midwest is a follow-up to the national Dual Power Gathering at the Indiana Dunes in 2022,
      but is more regionally focused in an attempt to bring people from the midwest together to meet,
      spend time together, and discuss dual power strategies. Those beyond this region are
      certainly welcome as well.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Similar to DPG 2022, the event will be structured using an unconference model, and will be an
      experiment in collective learning and relationship building. During the event, we hope to
      foster an atmosphere of generative co-learning and co-creativity. We want to connect people
      and bring them together around shared work.
      <br>
      <br>
      We seek to create a space where ideas are exchanged, stories are told, and futures are imagined,
      especially in the context of building dual power. With a few exceptions, the gathering won't have
      a solid schedule going into it. Rather, we'll collectively create the spaces we want and need
      to see throughout the weekend.
