<summary>What does the cost of your ticket cover?</summary>

We are asking each attendee to purchase a ticket in order for us to get an idea of how many people we should expect along with covering the costs of the event. Tickets will cover the cost of reservation $2700, the cost of vegan food being catered for lunch and dinner two days of the three day even (cost is unknown at the moment, but likely around $1,000).

We have camping capacity for approximately 120 campers, some of which will be able to use cabins that have bunk beds. We are priortizing use of cabins for those with mobility needs or other needs that would require/benefits from sleeping on a bed rather than in a tent. If that sounds like something you might need, please contact us at midwestdualpower@protonmail.com.
